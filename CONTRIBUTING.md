   - Create new AI agents using our framework
   - Improve existing agents
   - Develop integrations with external services

2. **Framework Development**
   - Enhance the core AI agent framework
   - Add new features for agent interconnection
   - Optimize performance and scalability

### For Web3 Developers

1. **Smart Contract Development**
   - Improve bonding curve mechanics
   - Enhance token utilities
   - Develop new DeFi integrations

2. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Optimize SUI blockchain integration
   - Implement cross-chain functionality
   - Enhance security measures

### For Community Contributors

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
   - Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Ensure all tests pass with `pnpm test`
6. Create a pull request

## Code Standards

### Smart Contracts

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Include proper error handling

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suite
pnpm test:contracts    # For smart contracts
pnpm test:agents      # For AI agents
pnpm test:framework   # For framework
```
